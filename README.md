### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learn and apply BEM principles for class namings.
It is best to reset the display property of img to block to avoid 5px of gap.
Also learned CSS custom properties and the application of var() in CSS styles.

### Continued development

Build more projects and get better to CSS and learn JS.
